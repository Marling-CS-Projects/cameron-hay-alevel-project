# 1.2 Stakeholders

The stakeholders for my project would mainly be a younger audience (between the ages of 7-14) due to it focusing on the more casual side of platforming and puzzles. This means the game's models and levels will be based off of more simple designs and easier to understand level design, more obvious cues could be used.

### Pegi Ratings

PEGI is a good indication for an age rating of people that will play the game, my platformer would be a PEGI 7 rated game due to it not being easy enough for people in the age range of PEGI 3 due to PEGIS official guidance (Pegi, 2017)&#x20;

### ESRB Ratings

ESRB provides additional information to parents / gamers on the content of the game these stakeholders can then make more informed choices of what to buy their loved one, ESRB ratings contain three parts: Rating Categories, Content Description and Interactive Elements. I would rate my game as Everyone 10+ as it contains content that is suitable for everyone aged 10 and upwards.

### Casual Gamers vs Experienced Gamers

This graph displays that over half of gamers have identified themselves as casual players (56.6%) this is by far the largest demographic of all gamers and who i will be aiming my project at pleasing.\
people who consider themselves to be casual gamers are generally more likely to have fun playing either competitive / casual games whereas competitive players will only enjoy competitive games thus lowering the amount of people that my product could be aimed at.
