| Feature           | Justification                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Saving System     | Players will want to keep their progress throughout the game - this might be done with a JSON file.                                     |
| 3D/2D platforming | The game will use Fez's most core mechanic, rotating the camera around a 3D environment to create four 2D interacting levels per world. |
| Puzzles           | Puzzles are integral to any non-combat platforming game and may be more appealing to casual players.                                    |
| Pixel Art         | The style of pixel art fits platformers and appeals to a wider audience.                                                                |

{% tab title="Features I wont" %}
| Feature                | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Open world             | Fez has a system of visiting worlds and collecting cubes to progress, you don't have to complete all the puzzles, just have to collect enough cubes - i want my players to complete all of the puzzles before moving on. |
| Storyline              | Fez has a storyline that adds meaning to the gameplay - I wont be including this because it is not necessary to the project.                                                                                             |
| Non - resetting death  | Fez has a system wherein if you fall off of the map, you will restart from where you fell off of - I want my players to try the puzzle again.                                                                            |
| Look - around controls | Too many controls can clutter the gameplay for the player, and most of the time they end up not using them due to how many there are.                                                                                    |
