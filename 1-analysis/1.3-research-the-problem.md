### Overview&#x20;

It was developed by Polytron Corporation and released by trapdoor games in 2012. Technically the game is open world with backtracking as you traverse through different levels wile collecting cubes to rebuild what you destroyed at the start. Fez has been launched on PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Windows, Linux, Mac OS and iOS. Fez is rated a PEGI 3 on PEGI's age range table due to it being pixelated and not very violent.

| Saving System     | Players will want to keep their progress throughout the game - this might be done with a JSON file.                                     |
| 3D/2D platforming | The game will use Fez's most core mechanic, rotating the camera around a 3D environment to create four 2D interacting levels per world. |
| Puzzles           | Puzzles are integral to any non-combat platforming game and may be more appealing to casual players.                                    |
| Pixel Art         | The style of pixel art fits platformers and appeals to a wider audience.                                                                |

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Open world             | Fez has a system of visiting worlds and collecting cubes to progress, you don't have to complete all the puzzles, just have to collect enough cubes - i want my players to complete all of the puzzles before moving on. |
| Storyline              | Fez has a storyline that adds meaning to the gameplay - I wont be including this because it is not necessary to the project.                                                                                             |
| Non - resetting death  | Fez has a system wherein if you fall off of the map, you will restart from where you fell off of - I want my players to try the puzzle again.                                                                            |
| Look - around controls | Too many controls can clutter the gameplay for the player, and most of the time they end up not using them due to how many there are.                                                                                    |
| Vines                  | Vines are too hard to code, especially if you turn the camera while attached.                                                                                                                                            |

### Super Mario Bros

![Super Mario Bros Wii (2009)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1).png>)

### Overview

Super Mario Bros is a 2D side scrolling platformer that plays out in 2D, despite the models all being 3D polygonal renders, in the game you clear obstacles to get to the end goal and collect coins along the way.

Mario is a side scrolling game where you need to get to the exit to progress and defeat bowser, an Evil Koopa that has taken the princess peach from Mario, he achieves this via jumping on toads, turtles and collecting coins these coins are what i might take from the game as collectable items that increase score in harder to reach areas or just everywhere, if you collect enough you could potentially have enough to gain a life.&#x20;

### Controls

![Wii remote](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

Super Mario bros was designed exclusively for the Nintendo Wii and so had different controls to a game i would develop on the computer, such controls were on a Wii remote (see above) - The remote would be held horizontally and so if you pressed the D-pad left or right it would move Mario in those directions, if you pressed 2 (located at the bottom of the remote) it would make Mario jump and if held 1 down you could sprint, tapping 1 would also use the power ability you had acquired as well.

| Controls          | Mario's controls are simple and intuitive.                                                                      |

| Large amount of power-ups | A large amount of power ups clutter the game and are harder to code in.                                                                                                   |
| Time limit on levels      | A time limit on levels makes the game more stressful if it is too low and if it is too high then it is not needed for the level - I think it should just not be included. |
| Life system               | Super Mario Bros used lives to send you back to level one, I think this is unfair so when you fall you should just restart the level you were on.                         |

### The Pedestrian

![The Pedestrian (2020)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1).png>)

### Overview

The pedestrian, uses both genres of side scrolling and puzzles to navigate and complete the objectives of the game, you leap from street sign to street sign while moving objects between them and moving the puzzles externally to create new routes to complete the level, often times unlocking one way doors to backtrack and complete more.

### Controls

![a keyboard with the WASD and 1234 Keys highlighted](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>)

the Pedestrian uses the standard WASD computer controls to control you character in which you grab and avoid traps and items if you click Q it grabs what is in front of you and Q again to drop / connect it to whatever it needs to be connected to, the main usage of the mouse in the game is repositioning the rest of the level and connecting stages, you can drag pieces of the signs above each other or lines between doors to travel between them with your character.

| Teleporting               | It would be an added puzzle element that could enhance the gameplay significantly and not be too hard to implement.                                                          |
| Different Areas as levels | The Pedestrian uses "signs" as their level system when you cross through the levels it physically moves you to that point in the scene i think it would add a unique effect. |

| Wires                 | The wires function in the game wrap around other objects and follow the character, I feel like that would be hard to implement.                             |
| Moving through layers | In the game you can place levels on top of each other to move between them, i feel like this would be more difficult to implement in a more 3D environment. |
