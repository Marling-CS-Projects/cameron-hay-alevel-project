### Fez

Fez is a 2D puzzle platformer that takes place in a 3D environment from four different angles to create a unique gameplay design and even more unique puzzles. The game was developed by Polytron Corporation and was published by Trapdoor games on the 13th April 2012.

### Aspects of the game

Fez uses UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT for movement controls and A / D to move around the 3D space in predetermined positions so you can use the platforms and climb up towers to find cubes in the world, the fez world uses a map that you can travel through to collect these cubes towards an end goal, if the puzzle is confusing you can move the camera with J / I / K / L around to see more of the level. The interact button is L-shift and also Enter (this can be quite confusing as there are a lot of controls) some of the puzzles include rooms that you have to rotate to get through, an example of this is in the first world where you have to rotate the original starting point by 180° in order to access a secret map - a reward that will lead the player to an anti-cub; especially hidden versions of the normal cube.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Saving System     | Players will want to keep their progress throughout the game - this might be done with a JSON file.                                     |
| 3D/2D platforming | The game will use Fez's most core mechanic, rotating the camera around a 3D environment to create four 2D interacting levels per world. |
| Puzzles           | Puzzles are integral to any non-combat platforming game and may be more appealing to casual players.                                    |
| Pixel Art         | The style of pixel art fits platformers and appeals to a wider audience.                                                                |

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Open world             | Fez has a system of visiting worlds and collecting cubes to progress, you don't have to complete all the puzzles, just have to collect enough cubes - i want my players to complete all of the puzzles before moving on. |
| Storyline              | Fez has a storyline that adds meaning to the gameplay - I wont be including this because it is not necessary to the project.                                                                                             |
| Non - resetting death  | Fez has a system wherein if you fall off of the map, you will restart from where you fell off of - I want my players to try the puzzle again.                                                                            |
| Look - around controls | Too many controls can clutter the gameplay for the player, and most of the time they end up not using them due to how many there are.                                                                                    |
| Vines                  | Vines are too hard to code, especially if you turn the camera while attached.                                                                                                                                            |

![Super Mario Bros Wii (2009)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png>)

### Super Mario Bros

Super Mario Bros is a 2.5D side scrolling platformer that plays out in 2D, despite the models all being 3D polygonal renders, in the game you clear obstacles to get to the end goal and collect coins along the way.

### Aspects of the game&#x20;

Mario is a side scrolling game where you need to get to the exit to progress and defeat bowser, an evil koopa that has taken the princess peach from Mario, he achieves this via jumping on toads, turtles and collecting coins these coins are what i might take from the game as collectable items that increase score in harder to reach areas or just everywhere, if you collect enough you might potentially have enough to gain a life.&#x20;

| Object Collection | Object collection - such as coins can give a reason or objective to the level / game as a whole.                |
| Controls          | Mario's controls are simple and intuitive.                                                                      |
| Bright colours    | These can highlight important areas and guide the player, contrast could also be used but isn't unique to Mario |

| Large amount of power-ups | A large amount of power ups clutter the game and are harder to code in.                                                                                                   |
| Time limit on levels      | A time limit on levels makes the game more stressful if it is too low and if it is too high then it is not needed for the level - I think it should just not be included. |
| Life system               | Super Mario Bros used lives to send you back to level one, I think this is unfair so when you fall you should just restart the level you were on.                         |

| Teleporting               | It would be an added puzzle element that could enhance the gameplay significantly and not be too hard to implement.                                                          |
| Different Areas as levels | The Pedestrian uses "signs" as their level system when you cross through the levels it physically moves you to that point in the scene i think it would add a unique effect. |

| Wires                 | The wires function in the game wrap around other objects and follow the character, I feel like that would be hard to implement.                             |
| Moving through layers | In the game you can place levels on top of each other to move between them, i feel like this would be more difficult to implement in a more 3D environment. |
