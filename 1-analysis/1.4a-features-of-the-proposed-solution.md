# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Movement

Movement in a 3D space is inherently harder than movement in a 2D space due to there being an extra dimension but my character will only move in any two directions at once based on where the camera is viewing them from. This can be done by giving the character linear acceleration; which is better than instant movement as it gives more options to the player for movement as the character will first be slower as it speeds up to normal speed, however when it decelerates it should stop instantly to prevent the player from sliding off of edges that are unintended and frustrating. add stuff waffling about jumping here cam!

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
