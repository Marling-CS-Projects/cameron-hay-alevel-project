| 1        | The Levels should consist of floating platforms for the players to stand on from multiple angles and should clearly be safe to interact with for the player. | Clearly indicated platforms should make the game easier to understand for first time users.                                                                                                   | [Level Design & Layout](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design-and-layout)                    |
| 2        | There should be a decent amount of levels 3-5                                                                                                                | Due to the nature of this project and working in 3D I propose 4 levels to make the experience long enough for the player to learn mechanics.                                                  | [Length of gameplay](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#length-of-gameplay)                            |
| 3        | The Levels include puzzles that are easy to begin with but get harder as you progress.                                                                       | A game that takes no skill / learning is simply not fun as a puzzle game and impossibly hard levels are not fun to play.                                                                      | [Puzzles](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#puzzles)                                                  |
| 4        | The puzzles should be set out in such a way that utilises learning the core mechanics of the game.                                                           | If the core mechanics of the game are not used then what would be the point in adding 4-point perspective, it also makes the game more challenging as you have to think about every rotation. | [Four-Point Orthographic View](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#four-point-orthographic-camera-view) |
| 5        | In cooperate Obstacles into the levels                                                                                                                       | If you have no obstacles the player is left to go through the level without hinderance and will complete it very fast, this is less fun than a challenging level.                             | [Obstacles](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#obstacles)                                              |

| 6        | Movement                  | The game could not be interacted with if you cannot move.                                                                    | [Movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)                               |
| 7        | Collision Detection       | The Game needs to be able to detect whether or not you are on a block, or else you would fall straight through the platform. | [Collisions](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#collisions)                           |
| 8        | Add Acceleration          | Acceleration allows for the player to have more control as the movement is not binary on or off.                             | [Movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)                               |
| 9        | Camera follows the player | This allows the player to see the character.                                                                                 | [Camera view](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#four-point-orthographic-camera-view) |

| 10       | When playing through the levels the transition should be seamless                      | if there is a jarring transition it would take away from the immersion and problem solving thought process of the game. | Length of gameplay  |
| 11       | Player should be able to see what items they have at all times                         | This should allow the user to be able to think about their next move without opening a menu.                            | User interface      |

| 14       | The Game should run without crashing                                                   | if the game were to suddenly not function, the audience would lose interest and eventually stop playing the game. | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md#justification-for-computational-methods)          |
| 15       | The game should not have choppy graphics                                               | If the game were to have choppy graphics it would be unpleasant to play.                                          | [Computational methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md#justification-for-computational-methods)          |
| 16       | Game should have a colour scheme with objects that are interactable being highlighted. | The player should be able to instantly tell what is a platform and what is a part of a background.                | [Graphics and other game art](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics-and-ui-user-interface) |
