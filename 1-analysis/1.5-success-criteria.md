| 1        | The Levels should consist of floating platforms for the players to stand on from multiple angles and should clearly be safe to interact with for the player. | Clearly indicated platforms should make the game easier to understand for first time users.                                                                                                                                                    | [Level Design & Layout](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design-and-layout)                    |
| 2        | There should be a decent amount of levels 3-5                                                                                                                | Due to the nature of this project and working in 3D I propose 4 levels to make the experience long enough for the player to learn mechanics and get an idea for a range of difficulty with it (the difficulty) increasing as the levels go on. | [Length of gameplay](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#length-of-gameplay)                            |
| 3        | The Levels include puzzles that are easy to begin with but get harder as you progress.                                                                       | A game that takes no skill / learning is simply not fun as a puzzle game and impossibly hard levels are not fun to play.                                                                                                                       | [Puzzles](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#puzzles)                                                  |
| 4        | The puzzles should be set out in such a way that utilises learning the core mechanics of the game.                                                           | If the core mechanics of the game are not used then what would be the point in adding 4-point perspective, it also makes the game more challenging as you have to think about every rotation.                                                  | [Four-Point Orthographic View](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#four-point-orthographic-camera-view) |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
