| 1        | The Levels should consist of floating platforms for the players to stand on from multiple angles and should clearly be safe to interact with for the player. | Clearly indicated platforms should make the game easier to understand for first time users.                                                                                                   | [Level Design & Layout](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design-and-layout)                    |
| 2        | There should be a decent amount of levels 3-5                                                                                                                | Due to the nature of this project and working in 3D I propose 4 levels to make the experience long enough for the player to learn mechanics.                                                  | [Length of gameplay](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#length-of-gameplay)                            |
| 3        | The Levels include puzzles that are easy to begin with but get harder as you progress.                                                                       | A game that takes no skill / learning is simply not fun as a puzzle game and impossibly hard levels are not fun to play.                                                                      | [Puzzles](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#puzzles)                                                  |
| 4        | The puzzles should be set out in such a way that utilises learning the core mechanics of the game.                                                           | If the core mechanics of the game are not used then what would be the point in adding 4-point perspective, it also makes the game more challenging as you have to think about every rotation. | [Four-Point Orthographic View](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#four-point-orthographic-camera-view) |
| 5        | In cooperate Obstacles into the levels                                                                                                                       | If you have no obstacles the player is left to go through the level without hinderance and will complete it very fast, this is less fun than a challenging level.                             | [Obstacles](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#obstacles)                                              |

| 6        | Movement                      | The game could not be interacted with if you cannot move.                                      | [Movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement)     |
| 7        | Collision Detection & Physics | The Game needs to be able to detect whether or not you are on a block, or else you would fall. | [Collisions](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#collisions) |
