# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

In my success criteria, there were 2 requirements that fit the category of function and robustness. As development of the project has been halted, now is the right to run these tests to inform any future development.

| Criterion | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 14        | The Game Should Run without Crashing                  |
| 15        | The Game should not have choppy Graphics (sub 30 FPS) |

### Criterion 14

For the first criteria, the game should run without crashing I tried to test the limits of the game, since the levels are very basic I tried to do every combination of inputs at once to test if any of them broke or made the game crash, they all functioned correctly.

### Criterion 15

For the second criteria the game should be able to run at a stable framerate, this is easily achieved on most devices as all of the levels are not loaded at once, this significantly reduces the load on the browser and therefore keeps the game running well - I could cap the framerate at a certain level but that would be more development time.
