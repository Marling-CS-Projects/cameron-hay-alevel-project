# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

In my success criteria, there were 2 requirements that fit the category of function and robustness. As development of the project has been halted, now is the right to run these tests to inform any future development.

| Criterion | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 14        | The Game Should Run without Crashing                  |
| 15        | The Game should not have choppy Graphics (sub 30 FPS) |

### Criterion 14

For the first criteria, the game should run without crashing I tried to test the limits of the game, since the levels are very basic I tried to do every combination of inputs at once to test if any of them broke or made the game crash, they all functioned correctly.

### Criterion 15
