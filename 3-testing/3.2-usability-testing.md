# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

To assess the usability of the game, I have put together a few extra tests to see how a player finds their experience of playing the game. They are being used to assess the 5 key points:

| Test               | Question                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Are the controls sufficient? Is the game easy to navigate?                                                                                        |
| 2 - Efficient      | are the menus easy to navigate?                                                                                                                   |
| 3 - Engaging       | Did you enjoy playing the game? Are there enough levels? Do the puzzles increase in difficulty? Are the graphics able to display different items? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game run? Does the game crash?                                                                                                           |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is the tutorial sufficient for learning the game? Is each level unique?                                                                           |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### Effective

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I asked this question because I wanted to know if everyone understood the controls and how to use them, the unanimous opinion was yes - I added many different keybinds that do the same thing such as the arrowkeys and wasd functioning similarly.

### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Some people in this question answered that the game was not easy to navigate, this may be due to the jumping in the game being very static up and down movement, it can be fixed but it would take more development time.

### Efficient&#x20;

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I wanted to know if the menus were quickly understandable and clearly they were, in some other games menus can be overwhelming, but every player agreed.

### Engaging

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Pretty much everyone enjoyed playing the game, the one that didn't probably had an issue with the controls or didn't understand the tutorial like everyone else did.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I personally believe that there are not enough levels in the game, just barely enough to&#x20;

### User Feedback

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description           |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| X         | describe the critiera |
