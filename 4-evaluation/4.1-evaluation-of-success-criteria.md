| 4         | The puzzles should be set out in such a way that utilises learning the core mechanics of the game.                                                           | Cycle 8                          |

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The floors are floating and you can clearly stand on them from any angle

### Criterion 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are 3 different unique levels this meets the criterion that i set out the achieve.

### Criterion 3

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The levels start off simple, each introducing a new mechanic - therefore keeping the difficulty hard and continuing the learning the process.

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The levels require you to rotate the camera to progress through them

### Criterion 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

one of the obstacles is this blue button, without activating it you cannot finish the level.

### Criterion 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

these controls allow the character to move around the level&#x20;

### Criterion 7

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The player is able to stand on the blocks, as evidenced by this screenshot and my slides

### Criterion 8

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The camera moves when the character moves, and resets the the players position when they die, it  moves left and right but not up or down as i feel that would be too disorienting.

### Criterion 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you reach the red block in any level, it takes you back to the main menu

### Criterion 10

Feature not added

### Criterion 11

Feature not added

### Criterion 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game does not crash even if extensive keys are used, as it is quite graphically simple

### Criterion 13

Feature not added

### Criterion 14

The game isnt very graphically intensive so it runs really well, so it doesn't have any choppy graphics.

### Criterion 15

each object that you can interact with is highlighted in a different colour.

portals

### Criterion 16

Each level is unique, with a different layout / learning curve
