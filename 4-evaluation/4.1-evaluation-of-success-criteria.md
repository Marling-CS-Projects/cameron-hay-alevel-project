### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The floors are floating and you can clearly stand on them from any angle

### Criterion 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are 3 different unique levels this meets the criterion that i set out the achieve.

### Criterion 3

The levels start off simple, each introducing a new mechanic - therefore keeping the difficulty hard and continuing the learning the process.

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The levels require you to rotate the camera to progress through them

### Criterion 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

one of the obstacles is this blue button, without activating it you cannot finish the level.

### Criterion 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

you can navigate around the levels with these keys
