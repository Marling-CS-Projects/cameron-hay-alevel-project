## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                                 | Success/Fail |

| 1           | You can move around the map to reach the end of the level with the controls | Success      |
| 2           | It is easy to know where to go in the level                                 | Success      |

### Feature 1

The controls are sufficient enough to play the game, some comments from the testers said that the jump was a bit too linear and hard to use, but that can be improved if further work is done, and more sentiments showed that the use of multiple binds at once to fit everyone's playstyle was good.

### Feature 2

The levels were designed in such a way that your goal is always in sight, whether it be a blue button or a red block you should always be able to tell what the next obstacle you have to overcome is.

| 1           | The game is fun to play                                                                    | Success      |
| 2           | 3-4 levels to play                                                                         | Success      |
| 3           | The levels constantly keep the player engaged by getting harder                            | Success      |
| 4           | Different interactable are different colours, so you can tell the difference between them. | Success      |

### Feature 1

The majority of the answers in usability testing said that the game was fun to play, but needed more content so I believe that this feature was a success.

### Feature 2

There are a decent amount of levels in the game to play, each bringing a different mechanic to the table and the tutorial explaining how to play the game.

### Feature 3

By introducing new mechanics every level it keeps the player fresh and learning, this is more enjoyable as the gameplay doesn't get repetitive.

### Feature 4

The different things in the levels are distinguished by their colour, this tells the player what to expect when they are interacting with one, such as a button press or level end.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description             | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game runs           | Success      |
| 2           | The game does not crash | Success      |

### Feature 1

The game functions when you press play and navigate to the levels, I have tested extensively to try and make it not run but I haven't found anything obvious.

### Feature 2

The game, when under any amount of stress shouldn't crash while it is standalone.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                        | Success/Fail |

| 1           | The tutorial makes it easy to understand the game. | Success      |

### Feature 1

The tutorial is a level with text on the side explaining the controls and the game rules, the responses from my usability testing confirmed that it was helpful.
