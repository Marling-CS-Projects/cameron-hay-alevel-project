# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Graphics and other Game Art - the game has very simple colours
* Length of Gameplay - There are only 3 completed levels and 1 mini level to play
* Platform Support - It can only be played on PC or Mac with a keyboard in the browser

## Maintenance

The game would require different maintenance strategies depending on the whether the aims for the project were to keep it the same size or allow there to be room for it to grow and expand, such as new mechanics such as an inventory / collectables.

### Current Size

### Room for growth

## Future Development

### Short Term Plan

* Add acceleration/ deceleration
* Make the jumps not so linear with a multiplier based on remaining 'charges' of jump left
* Finish level 3 & change portals to diamonds instead of rectangles
* Only unlock levels after completing the previous ones

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

* Platform support
