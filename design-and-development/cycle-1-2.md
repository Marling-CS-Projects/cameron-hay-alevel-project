# 2.2.1 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

Get a player model to render and have collision with the floor blocks

* [x] create a player class that I can edit easily.
* [x] add bounding boxes to both the player and the floor so it can detect when the collide.
* [x] make the player character move so I can test if collision works.

### Usability Features

The system needs to be able to detect if objects are colliding, I will do this by checking every object against the player every frame, this is not scale able and I will have to have a better solution at some point.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```

## Development

### Outcome

### Challenges

Getting JavaScript nodes & imports to work

## Testing

Evidence for testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
|      |              |               | As expected           | Pass      |
