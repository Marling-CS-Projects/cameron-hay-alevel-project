# 2.2.4 Cycle 4 \*

## Design

### Objectives

get the game character to jump.

* [x] The Scene displays
* [x] the level has a "puzzle" tutorial that uses jumps
* [x] the player character can jump with a smooth up and down motion

### Usability Features

on a keypress, if you are grounded, make they character move up and down independently from the arrow keys

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| onGround      | to check if the player is on the floor                           |
| jumpCount     | the amount of "charges" the jump has before it begins to go down |
| isJumping     | checks if the player is currently jumping                        |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```
